Version XXX - replace this as needed

Version 2.x - Aug 2014, by Amir Taaki and Eric Voskuil

* openssl no longer used inside libbitcoin. Replaced by libgmp-dev and 
  libsecp256k1. openssl remains as a dependency for validation of test results.

* elliptic_curve_key no longer used inside libbitcoin. Replaced by 
  the new ec_keys class, which is based on libsecp256k1. elliptic_curve_key
  now lives in test as a means to compare the test results against the new
  implementation.

* Migrated crypto stuff to new library libwallet.

* Rework protocol code to have fixed connection slots.

* tools/detect-network to see network libbitcoin is compiled for.

* bootstrap blockchain from .dat tool.
