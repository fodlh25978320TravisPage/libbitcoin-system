All files in this repository fall under the license specified in LICENSE
Right now, the project is licensed under the AGPL but we're still working
on a different license and plan to relicense the project at a later date.

You will need:

  - g++ 4.6
  - cppdb
  - boost

Build cppdb using the instructions on their site.

  $ svn co http://cppcms.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cppcms/cppdb/trunk cppdb-trunk
  $ cd cppdb-trunk
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/smf/libbitcoin/usr/ ..  -DPQ_BACKEND_INTERNAL=1
  $ make
  # make install

Edit the Makefile CFLAGS and LIBS variables to get the project to compile.
Import the database too.

  $ psql bitcoin < bitcoin.sql

A good place to start is to run:

  $ make net
  $ ./bin/tests/nettest

This is still a work in progress.
