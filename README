All files in this repository fall under the license specified in LICENSE
As of now, the project is licensed under the AGPL but we're still working
on a different license and plan to relicense the project at a later date.

You will need:

  - g++ 4.6
  - cppdb
  - boost

Edit the Makefile CFLAGS and LIBS variables to get the project to compile.

A good place to start is to run:

  $ make net
  $ ./bin/tests/nettest

This is still a work in progress.
