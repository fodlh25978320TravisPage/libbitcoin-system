// This can be integrated into round() using a [bool Trace = false] template
// argument. Dumping each round to a normal form provides a common view between
// the two common implementation approaches (buffer vs. circular queue), as
// described in FIPS180. This applies to both SHA and MD algorithm families.
// This may be useful when implementing vectorization and sha-ni/neon, as all
// reference/example code is implemented using the latter approach.
