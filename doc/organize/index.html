<em>A document describing the functioning of the organize algorithm.</em>
</p>

<p>New blocks when they first come in are added to the orphans pool. The
pool does not order the blocks. To trace a chain of blocks from an endpoint
you have to keep looking up the previous block as you go backwards.</p>

<p>Assuming we have a valid genesis block, then this pool would produce
2 chains like this:</p>

<img src="tree.png" />

<p>We loop through every block in the orphan's pool, setting each block to
processed each loop. This stops us re-processing a block when a new block is
added again to the pool, re-triggering the organize algorithm.</p>

<p>The blockchain is only ever stored as one main chain. In the blockchain
database is only stored the currently accepted history. Blocks added to the
blockchain are taken out of the orphan's pool, and returned back to the pool
when removed from the blockchain.</p>

<p>If we have the chain:</p>

<pre>
0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2a -&gt; 3a
</pre>

<p>Then the remaining blocks in the orphan pool are 2b, 3b, 4b. Block 4b comes
into the pool and will trigger a re-organize. When we run the organize
algorithm, we find out that the chain 2b, 3b, 4b has greater difficulty.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Trace backwards through the pool until we cannot cycle backwards
    anymore. We call this the orphan-root.</li>
    <li>Organize will first find the fork point within the blockchain
    to be at block 1 using the orphan-root's previous block hash.</li>
    <li>The difficulty in the remaining blocks of the main chain and the chain
    in the orphan pool are calculated. If the main chain algorithm's difficulty
    is bigger than the orphan's, then the algorithm stops and the main chain
    is untouched.</li>
    <li>The new blocks in the orphan pool will replace the ones in the main
    chain. The end blocks from the main chain are popped off and returned
    back to the orphan pool. The blocks from the orphan pool are added
    to the main chain as the new chain.</li>
    <li>Reorganization has finished.</li>
