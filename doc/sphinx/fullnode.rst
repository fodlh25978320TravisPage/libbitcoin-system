If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there's some task
you'd like to automate.  For example, you may wish to perform a
search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a
bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you'd like to write a small
custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.


Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably.  Programs written
in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C,  C++, or Java programs,
for several reasons:

* the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single
  statement;

* statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending
  brackets;

* no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
