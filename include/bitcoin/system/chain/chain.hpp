// Wire deserialization.
// Objects deserialized off the p2p/server protocol are not aggregated into
// composites. Message objects are fully self-deserializing. However it is
// often necessary to iterate over collections of hashes and headers using a
// sequence of closures, where one element is passed to the closure and the
// next passed on its completion handler until all are processed. To avoid
// copying, each element could be deserialized into vectors of shared pointers.
// However a shared pointer to the containing object must be passed into the
// closure for iteration, which keeps references to its members alive. Instead
// an element may be passed as std::ref(element), avoiding the overhead of a
// shared pointer copy, in the case where the parent object maintains lifetime.

// Wire serialization.
// Objects obtained from the store in response to p2p/server queries are
// deserialized in parts and aggregated. For example, inputs and outputs are
// obtained for a transaction, and then passed into the transaction, the header
// and transactions are obtained for a block and then passed into the block.
// To avoid costly object copies/moves of collections, we store inputs::cptr,
// and outputs::cptr on transaction, and transactions::cptr on block. Otherwise
// a copy/move operation is required for at least a vector of pointers, which
// may number in the thousands, where pointers are not used in the vector this
// would apply to all object instances as well.

// Consensus validation.
// Op.data is stored as a data_ptr, allowing all push_data to be stacked with a
// pointer copy. Operations are smaller than pointers, so these are copied.
// Witnesses and scripts contain vectors of pointers and operations,
// respectively, so these two objects are always moved as pointers. Point and
// header contain hashes, so these are always moved as pointers. Points,
// prevouts, outputs, inputs and transactions are much larger than pointers, so
// these can reasonably be moved by pointer, although at a 16 byte per instance
// storage cost. Inputs, and outputs must be created as sets and then moved
// into a new transaction for signature hashing, so these are retained by
// transaction as a vector::ptr. A transaction set is never added to a block
// for validation, but transactions are retained as vector::ptr for wire
// serialization.
